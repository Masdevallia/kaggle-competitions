The goal of this project was to participate in two Kaggle competitions to put into practice our knowledge of supervised machine learning methods.

* Diamonds competition (regression problem): https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad1019/overview
* Avila Bible competition (classification problem): https://www.kaggle.com/c/avila-bible-datamad1019/overview

### Diamonds competition:

In this competition we had to predict the price of some diamonds based on their characteristics (color, clarity quality of cut, carat weight, etc.).

#### STEPS:

* Data preparation: Feature selection and extraction:
    * Convert categorical variables (cut, color, clarity) to numbers with ordinal encoding.
    * Drop highly correlated features: x, y, z.
    * Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers: RobustScaler().
* Train-test split to divide the data in X_ train, X_test, y_train, y_test.
* Model building, training and evaluation (R2 and RMSE): Linear Regression, SVR, K Neighbors Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
* H2OAutoML: Auto Machine Learning.
* Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV.
* Call predict on the estimator with the best found parameters: Train selected model with all Kaggle train dataset and predict test.

### Avila Bible competition:

In this competition we had to predict who was the scribe of a verse from the Avila bible according to the text format.

#### STEPS:

* Data examination
* Train-test split to divide the data in X_ train, X_test, y_train, y_test.
* Model building, training and evaluation (Accuracy and Confusion matrix): Logistic Regression, SVC, K Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
* Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV.
* Call predict on the estimator with the best found parameters: Train model with all Kaggle train dataset and predict test.
